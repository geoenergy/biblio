abstract = {Over the last few years the Western Alpine Molasse Basin (WAMB) has been attracting large institutional, industrial and scientific interest to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal energy production. However, the thermal state of the basin, which is instrumental to the development of such geothermal projects, has remained to date poorly known. Here, we compile and correct temperature measurements (mostly bottom hole temperature) from 26 existing well data mostly acquired during former hydrocarbon exploration in the basin. These data suggest that the average geothermal gradient of the WAMB is around 25–30 °C/km. We further use these data to build the first well data-driven 3D geostatistical temperature model of the whole basin and generate probabilistic maps of isotherms at 70 and 140 °C. This model highlights a number of positive and negative thermal anomalies that are interpreted in the context of heat advection caused by fluid circulation along faults and/or karst systems. This study confirms that the WAMB has a great potential for low-enthalpy geothermal resources and presents a typology of advection-dominated potential targets.},

abstract = {Ancient glacial sediments form major hydrocarbon plays in several parts of the world; most notably, North Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. We have described a methodology for reconstructing broad-scale paleogeographies in just such a depositional system, using an extensive subsurface data set from the uppermost Ordovician glacial sediments of the Murzuq Basin of southwest Libya. Our workflow begins with the analysis of a large, high-quality 3D seismic data set, to understand the frequency content. Subsequently, optimum frequency bands are extracted, after applying spectral decomposition, and then recombined into an R (red) G (green) B (blue) blended cube. This volume is then treated as an image within which paleomorphological features can be distinguished and compared with modern glacial analogs. Mapping at different depths (time slices) of these features is then tied, by integration with core and image-log sedimentology, to specific depositional environments defined within the framework of a facies scheme developed using the well data and published outcrop studies. These depositional environments are extrapolated into areas with little or no well data using the spectral decomposition as a framework, always taking into account the significant difference in vertical resolution between the seismic data set and core-scale descriptions. The result of this methodology is a set of calibrated maps, at three different time depths (two-way time travel), indicating paleogeographic reconstructions of the glacial depositional environments in the study area and the evolution through time (at different depths/time slices 2D + 1) of these glacial settings.},

@article{Moscariello2018,
abstract = {Detailed analysis of two-dimensional seismic lines acquired in the NE Java basin has been performed to unravel the subsurface geology of the region around the Lusi mud eruption. This work revealed the existence of a system consisting of a complex set of faults, here called the Watukosek fault system, forming triangular deformation zones converging at the top of the early Miocene Carbonates. This system continues downwards with vertical individual fault segments, often bordering the steep margins of the carbonate platforms. The analysis of data includes the interpretation of seismic lines, regional structural data inferred from basement gravity maps and present-day main direction of stress. Results suggest that a possible rotation of stress direction from N40E-S40W to N-S occurred during the post-Miocene history of the Java back arc tectonic evolution. The Watukosek fault system was first generated as a tensional lineament during the E-W sinistral transpressive strain, which involved the basement. In this phase, synthetic and antithetic Riedel faults formed, the former controlling the NW-SE orientation of the structural highs represented by Oligo-Miocene carbonate platforms. As a consequence of the rotation of the main principal stress direction to a N-S direction, the Watukosek fault and similar parallel lineaments became sinistral Riedel shears, developing intense triangular deformation zones. Based on the stratigraphic position of gentle anticlinal deformations with axis corresponding to the N40E-S40W oriented triangular deformation zones, the transpressive strain linked to the N-S main stress compression occurred likely in the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The detailed examination of a) stratigraphy at the wells BJP-1 and Porong-1 as well as b) the seismo-stratigraphic architecture of the entire succession in the study area, allowed a new subsurface interpretation and revision of the stratigraphic units below Lusi. The thick Early Miocene Tuban Formation is found sandwiched between the coheval Upper Kalibeng Formation and the Early Miocene Carbonate of the Kujung Formation, which in turn overlain the older Ngimbang Formation.},

abstract = {The Upper Jurassic carbonates represent important potential targeted reservoirs for geothermal energy in the Geneva Basin (Switzerland and France). Horizons affected by dolomitization, the focus of the present study, are of particular interest because they proved to be productive in time-equivalent deposits currently exploited in Southern Germany. The study is based on sub-surface samples and outcrops in the Geneva Basin. Petrographic analyses allowed to constrain the paragenesis of the Upper Jurassic units prior to discussing the cause(s) and effect(s) of dolomitization. Data reveal that the facies are affected by early and late diagenesis. All samples show at least two stages of burial blocky calcite cementation with the exception of those from the sub-surface, which display an incomplete burial blocky cementation preserving primary intercrystalline porosity. Dolomitization affected all units. The results point to an early dolomitization event, under the form of replacement dolomite. Dedolomitization, through calcitization and/or dissolution, is an important process, creating secondary pore space. Results of the present study favor a reflux model for dolomitization rather than the mixing-zone model suggested in earlier work. However, considering the geodynamic context, other dolomitization models cannot be excluded for the subsurface. The presence of secondary pore space might contribute to the connectivity of the porous network providing enhanced reservoir properties. These results are a first step towards a better understanding of the diagenetic history of the Upper Jurassic in the Geneva Basin. Moreover, it provides a reasonable framework for further geochemical analyses to constrain the nature and timing of fluid migration. The paragenesis and the dolomitization model hold the potential to help in ongoing exploration for geothermal energy beyond the Geneva Basin.},
